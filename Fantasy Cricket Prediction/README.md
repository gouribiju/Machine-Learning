# 🏏 Fantasy Cricket Match Winner Prediction
# 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict the winning team in a fantasy cricket match using Machine Learning models trained on Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2024. The dataset includes key match statistics such as teams, toss decisions, venues, and winning results.

# 🔍 Problem Statement
Fantasy cricket players rely on historical performance data to create their teams. This project builds a predictive model that helps fantasy cricket users make better team selection decisions based on data-driven insights.

# 📊 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
 * Missing Values Handling:
   * Filled missing city values for neutral venues (e.g., Dubai, Sharjah).
*Removed columns with excessive missing values (method, target_overs, super_over).
   * Feature Engineering:
   * Label Encoding: Converted categorical variables (e.g., team1, team2, winner).
*Outlier Removal: Used Interquartile Range (IQR) method to clean extreme values.
* Feature Selection:
   * Removed irrelevant columns (match_type, target_overs, super_over, method).
   * Selected important features using Random Forest feature importance ranking.

# 🏆 Machine Learning Models & Cross-Validation Performance
